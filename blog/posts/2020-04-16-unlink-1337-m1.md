In March 2019, I got a chance to design a CTF gameplay for my college technical festival. 

The CTF game is meant for beginners friendly, and I choose the challenges from the  day to day developers life perspective

I Named that CTF as an *Unlink-1337*, In this post, I like to share my experience of designing CTF challenges for the First time

# Unlink-1337

The CTF Challenge questions ranges from three catageries

First one is **Web Exploitation**

These Challenge questions can be easily solved by anyone who knows working with Browser developer tools

Next one Is  **Cryptography and Number system**

Because of the event timing constraints, I did not want to make complex Cryptography Challenges, so I choose Ceaser Cipher and basic number system

The final one is **OS/Analysis**

This challenge includes Network packet Analysis using wireshark and, Version control system using  a Git

 <hr/>

Okay! What is Mean By CTF:

In Information security perspective the Capture the flag is information security competition game containing challenges included in Computer Science Programming, or Analysing, and Hardware

It mainly played for fun and acquiring knowledge in the cybersecurity field

What is means by Flag:

The flags are a string, is the proof of you successfully solved the challenge
In Unlink-1337 the flag in the format of  *mzctf{somethinginsidehere}*

All the Challenges and Code are available in this Github repository [Unlink-1337-Github](https://github.com/naveenmicheal/unlink-1337)


**Challenge 1 Client-Side Auth:**

By opening the challenge there is one login box shown. But there is no username password given

In the hint tells, It is a client-side Auth, So there is no server-side Authentication happened here,

So how the client-side Authentication is done? 
The entered form values (username and password) are checked by Javascript by a simple if condition block 
if the conditions evaluated true, It just redirected to the flag page.

how did you view the JS file? View the page source by Pressing CTRL + U or anyone options you familiar with and analyze the js lines from the source code		

How to design that:
	It not hard, it can be designed by simple using HTML CSS and JS. View that code


**Challenge 2  I Agree Whatever (cookies)**

By opening the challenge, there is also one login page shows. But unlike that challenge1, whatever the username you given it just redirected to the page shows "You do not look like an admin"

By looking the Hint I agree Whatever, and the word Cookies, remembers that It related to Web cookies 

Cookies are the small data are stored in your browser by the websites you visit, It mainly used for tracking and maintaining sessions between user and server

How to access the Cookies? 
* 	  There are two types, First one is Using javascript. 
* 		Open your browser developer tools, and navigate to the consoles tab
* 		and execute the following Javascript code
		`document.cookie`  it lists all the cookies currently set by the websites, 
		
* 	by looking that the is a cookie called 	"admin" set to False
* For making that True, Execute the following Javascript code

	`document.cookie = "Admin=True"`
* 	It set that cookies named in Admin into true, 
* Then reload the page, so our new modified cookie sent over the server, and it shows the page

 Another one well-known method to view and manipulate Cookies	is open the developer console, and navigate to 	the Application tab, choose the Cookies and it will show that.

**How to designs the challenge:**

For checking the cookies and sent the appropriate response requires the server-side language,  here I am choosen *Python and Flask web framework*, you can also use PHP,Node.js Anything you preferred
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, and easy to work with, require very minimal lines to design simpler tasks, if you would to like learning python framework checkout that amazing book written by Miguel Grinberg   [Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python](https://www.amazon.in/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications/dp/9352136993/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=python+flask&qid=1587198592&sr=8-2)

Example: 

```
@app.route('/flagpage')
def flagpage():
	data = request.cookies.get("Admin")
	if data == 'True':
		return render_template('flag.html',flag = """mzctf{"AcC3p7-CoOK135-whA73v3R"}""")
	else:
		return render_template('flag.html', flag = 'mmmm But Looks Like You are not a Admin!')
```

The request.cookies.get() method get the cookie value named "Admin",  and send the responce page data according to that value


**Challenge 3: Robots Know Where it Is?**

In that challenge, the page shows the hints as "Robots know where it is?
It helps to hide it from Search Engine Eyes"

By looking the second hint, tells, That is used to hide something from the Search engine Eyes

Yes! here they are talking about the robots.txt
	Also known as robots exclusion protocol, It is the standard Text files that tell web robots what are pages you should not to crawl, learn more about web crawling here

Always the robots.txt fils is placed in the root of the websites

You can easily look at that file by visiting the location, [www.example.com/robots.txt]

Here the Example file:
```
User-agent: *
Allow :/index.html
Disallow: /N0-70-g00gl3.html
```
 It tells the search engines do not crawl this ("disallow") pages

But you can view the web page	by navigating the HTML page, you get the flag

**	Note:**
The robots.txt file can not stop the unethical search engine by crawling these pages nd also anyone can view that file, so avoid put any sensitive directories in here*


**Challenge 5: No Debug In Production (Intermediate Challenge):**
	
We can label the challenge as an intermediate one, Clues are not given in straightforwarded. understand by comman sense

By opening the challenge you see the hints like "DEBUGGING"," Flag file stored into the root of the application and the word like RESPONSE 
The word response remembers the response header, so open your developer console navigate to the Network tab, reload the page, look the response headers from the server. 

Here you can see two unusual response headers called *Debug-Pin", "1337-7331 and "Shell-Page-Location","/shell"*

Take note that,
By navigating to shell page location  *192.168.21.32:333/shell*

	Here you can see the Exception page, and that debugging has been turned on, This is Python Flask Debugging page

[Exceptipn Page](https://i.imgur.com/dC2e8z6.png?1)

Learn more [Python flask debugging ]https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Debug/)

* By clicking the last block and choose icon labeled as "Open and Interacting Python Shell in this frame"

* The popup screen asked to enter the Debugging PIN from the command line, But We already got the Debugging PIN from the Response Header

* Enter the PIN in here the box, Done !! Now you got the Interactive Python shell for that hosted application

* Now You can execute any python command in here, 

* For finding the flag, the hint tells the flag file is located in the root directory of the application, 

* There are two ways you can read the file by using the python file

* First one is Python file Handling and Next one is Using Python Subprocess module https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html

1. **File-Handling: **

```
file = open('flag.txt')
file.read()
```

2. **Subprocess module**

The python subprocess module used to execute Linx command tags inside the operating system, learn more from the official documentation
By running that lines in that shell, you get the flag 

```
import subprocess
subprocess.check_output(['cat','flag.txt'])
```

**Implementation:**
	First of  **you can not host that application on the Internet**  with the debugging mode enabled

If any exception if an error occurred on the hosted application it will not show the debugging interface otherwise it simply returns the server error page with "503" Status code

So you only can run the challenge application in your local network, you can expose that application in all the network interface by simply passing   host='0.0.0.0' argument in the app.run() method

Example: 
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port='3333', debug=True)
```
Now that the application can be accessed in your local network by connecting your Local IP address on the Browser 

In default the Debugger pin generated randomly in the application console, you can't pass the debugger pin normally 

So we want to assign our own debugger pin by using the flask environment variables 

`os.environ['WERKZEUG_DEBUG_PIN'] = '1337-7331'`

We send that pin and our own response headers by using that following line

```
resp = make_response(render_template('flag.html'), 200)
resp.headers.add_header("Debug-Pin","1337-7331")
resp.headers.add_header("Shell-Page-Location","/shell")
```
